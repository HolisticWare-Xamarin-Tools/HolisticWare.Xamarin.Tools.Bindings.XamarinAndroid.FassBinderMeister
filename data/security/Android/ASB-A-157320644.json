  "details": "In shouldBlockFromTree of ExternalStorageProvider.java, there is a possible permissions bypass. This could lead to local escalation of privilege, allowing an app to read private app directories in external storage, which should be restricted in Android 11, with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is needed for exploitation.",
