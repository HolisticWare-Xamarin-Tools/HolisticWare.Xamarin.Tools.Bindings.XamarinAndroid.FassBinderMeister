  "details": "In checkCallerIsSystemOr of CompanionDeviceManagerService.java, there is a possible way to get a nearby Bluetooth device's MAC address without appropriate permissions due to a permissions bypass. This could lead to local escalation of privilege that grants access to nearby MAC addresses, with User execution privileges needed. User interaction is needed for exploitation.",
