  "summary": "Bluetooth Classic (BR/EDR) data injection in L2CAP connections over piconet \"Leathery Coffee\"",
  "details": "In reassemble_and_dispatch of packet_fragmenter.cc, there is a possible way to inject packets into an encrypted Bluetooth connection due to improper input validation. This could lead to remote escalation of privilege between two Bluetooth devices by a proximal attacker, with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.",
