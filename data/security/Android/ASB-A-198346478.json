  "summary": "[AIDL] uninitialized memory reads with C++ enum values in bundles [unverified]",
  "details": "In code generated by BuildParcelFields of generate_cpp.cpp, there is a possible way for a crafted parcelable to reveal uninitialized memory of a target process due to uninitialized data. This could lead to local information disclosure across Binder transactions with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.",
